      # DCC SEND is a protocol for transferring files, usually found
      # in IRC. While the handshake, i.e. the details of the file
      # transfer, are transferred over IRC, the actual file transfer
      # happens directly between two clients. As such it doesn't put
      # stress on the IRC server.
      #
      # Cinch allows sending files by either using
      # {Cinch::User#dcc_send}, which takes care of all parameters as
      # well as setting up resume support, or by creating instances of
      # this class directly. The latter will only be useful to people
      # working on the Cinch code itself.
      #
      # {Cinch::User#dcc_send} expects an object to send as well as
      # optionaly a file name, which is sent to the receiver as a
      # suggestion where to save the file. If no file name is
      # provided, the method will use the object's `#path` method to
      # determine it.
      #
      # Any object that implements {DCC::DCCableObject} can be sent,
      # but sending files will probably be the most common case.
      #
      # If you're behind a NAT it is necessary to explicitly set the
      # external IP using the {file:docs/bot_options.md#dccownip dcc.own_ip
      # option}.
      #
      # @example Sending a file to a user
      #   match "send me something"

      #     m.user.dcc_send(open("/tmp/cookies"))
