*** TODO Persistent store                                           :feature:
    - optional dependencies
    - API to plug in other stores
    - provide a simple yaml store, maybe mongodb
*** TODO Add sanity checks for options                          :improvement:
    - [ ] check if encoding is valid
      - == :irc
      - Encoding.find
      - .is_a? Encoding
    - [ ] check if user name is correct
      - no spaces (a single word)
*** TODO Support SASL                                               :feature:

    :END:
*** TODO Add helper for inserting mIRC color codes into strings     :feature:
*** TODO filter colors from messages before passing them to regexen :improvement:
    - `:filter => false` to disable filtering
*** TODO Provide automatic per-server throttle options (looks like QuakeNet is more anal than Freenode) :feature:
    - Consider putting the throttling into a class of its own
*** TODO More meaningful exceptions when classes are used wrong :improvement:
    - More typechecking
    - warn about unknown options for methods taking argument hashes
      - Plugin.*
*** TODO Bot#ping to get the current delay to the server            :feature:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Depends:  feature/unload
    :END:
    - Use a cached value from the last time we pinged the server if no block is passed
*** TODO Allow plugin unloading                                     :feature:
    :PROPERTIES:

    - #unload hook
*** DONE Add a :leaving signal that captures :part, :quit, :kick and :kill :feature:
    CLOSED: [2011-10-14 Fri 14:48]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Branch: feature/leaving
    :END:
    - Problem: while for part, quit and kill m.user actually is the
      leaving user, it will be the kicker for kick
    - Introduces new signal :leaving
    - Introduces new method: Message#leaving_user
*** TODO Add an option to message splitting for prefixing each part with the nick :feature:
*** DONE Add support for an :action event-type [2/3]                :feature:
    CLOSED: [2011-09-02 Fri 14:11]
    - [X] Add the event-type :action
    - [X] Add Message#action?
    - [ ] Provide a proper Message#message, which filters away \001ACTION
          (Strictly speaking, this breaks backwards compatiblity, but we will take the risk...)
*** TODO Rejoin dynamically joined channels after a reconnect       :feature:
    - Make this configurable
    - Clear @bot.channels after the reconnect to get rid of not rejoined channels
    - Be sure to store passwords for channels
*** DONE Get rid of all useless checks (do methods for matchers/timers/executor/listener exist, etc) :refactor:
    CLOSED: [2011-09-02 Fri 15:03]
    - Phase 1: Print warnings if methods are missing
    - Phase 2 (Cinch v2.0.0): completly remove the checks and raise exceptions instead
    - Maybe consider printing nicely formatted errors (and quitting) instead of raw exceptions
*** TODO Support setting user modes                                 :feature:
*** TODO Support Rizon's stupid 263 "server load too high" code... :improvement:

    CLOSED: [2011-06-16 Thu 15:05]
    :PROPERTIES:
