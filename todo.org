*** TODO Bot#ping to get the current delay to the server
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Depends:  feature/unload
    :END:
    - Use a cached value from the last time we pinged the server if no block is passed
*** TODO Allow plugin unloading
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Depends:  feature/unload
    :END:
    - Have to keep track of registered handlers
    - #unload hook
*** TODO Add a :leaving signal that captures :part, :quit, :kick and :kill :feature:
    - Problem: while for part, quit and kill m.user actually is the
      leaving user, it will be the kicker for kick
*** TODO Add an option to message splitting for prefixing each part with the nick :feature:
*** TODO Add support for an :action event-type [0/3]                :feature:
    - [ ] Add the event-type :action
    - [ ] Add Message#action?
    - [ ] Provide a proper Message#message, which filters away \001ACTION
          (Strictly speaking, this breaks backwards compatiblity, but we will take the risk...)
*** TODO Rejoin dynamically joined channels after a reconnect       :feature:
    - Make this configurable
    - Clear @bot.channels after the reconnect to get rid of not rejoined channels
    - Be sure to store passwords for channels
*** TODO Get rid of all useless checks (do methods for matchers/timers/executor/listener exist, etc)
    - Phase 1: Print warnings if methods are missing
    - Phase 2 (Cinch v2.0.0): completly remove the checks and raise exceptions instead
    - Maybe consider printing nicely formatted errors (and quitting) instead of raw exceptions
*** TODO Support setting user modes                                 :feature:
*** TODO Deprecate Bot#halt
    Useless method, people should use next or break instead
*** TODO One-shot option for timer                              :improvement:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Depends: feature/unload
    :END:
*** TODO Channel#ops and an equivalent for voiced people (how do you call those, anyway?), halfops, admins :feature:
*** TODO Improve documentation
    - [ ] Check documentation for wrong multiline docs (e.g. Message#reply)
    - [ ] document the :use_suffix option of Plugin.match
    - [ ] Fix "eaxmple" typo
** TODO v2.0.0 [0/1]
