* Cinch 1.1.0, 15 January 2011
  - New signals
    - :op(<Message>message, <User>target)         – emitted when someone gets opped
    - :deop(<Message>message, <User>target)       – emitted when someone gets deopped
    - :voice(<Message>message, <User>target)      – emitted when someone gets voiced
    - :devoice(<Message>message, <User>target)    – emitted when someone gets devoiced
    - :halfop(<Message>message, <User>target)     – emitted when someone gets half-opped
    - :dehalfop(<Message>message, <User>target)   – emitted when someone gets de-half-opped
    - :ban(<Message>message, <Ban>ban)            – emitted when someone gets banned
    - :unban(<Message>message, <Ban>ban)          – emitted when someone gets unbanned
    - :mode_change(<Message>message, <Array>modes) – emitted on any mode change on a user or channel
    - :catchall(<Message>message)                 – a generic signal that matches any kind of event
  - New methods
    - User#last_nick    – stores the last nick of a user. This can for
      example be used in `on :nick` to compare a user's old nick against
      the new one.
    - User#notice, Channel#notice and Bot#notice – for sending notices
    - Message#to_s      – Provides a nicer representation of Message objects
    - Channel#has_user? – Provides an easier way of checking if a given
      user is in a channel
    - Channel#half_opped? – Check if a user is half-opped
  - Plugins/extensions can send their own events using Bot#dispatch
  - Modes as reported by Channel#users now use mode characters, not prefixes (e.g. "@" becomes "o")
  - Modes reported by Channel#users now are an array of modes, not a string anymore
  - The formatted logger (which is the default one) has been improved
    and now contains timestamps and won't use color codes when not
    writing to a tty. Additionally it can log objects which are not
    strings.
  - A minor bug in the handling of the original IRC casemap has been fixed
  - User#authed? now is synced and won't return a wrong value on the
    first use
  - The string "!help" in the middle of a message won't cause Cinch to
    print help messages anymore
  - Quitting will not cause a deadlock anymore
  - Using a regexp prefix with a string pattern no longer breaks Cinch
  - User and channel caching have been completly rewritten, allowing to
    run multiple bots at once. This deprecates and replaces the
    following methods (syntax: deprecated → substitution):
    - User.find_ensured    → UserManager#find_ensured
    - User.find            → UserManager#find
    - User.all             → UserManager#each
    - Channel.find_ensured → ChannelManager#find_ensured
    - Channel.find         → ChannelManager#find
    - Channel.all          → ChannelManager#each

    Additionally this changes fix a bug where wrong User/Channel objects
    could've been returned.
  - Additionally to prefixes, plugins can now have suffixes
    New option: plugins.suffix
  - Various improvements to the handling of SSL have been made
    - The option 'ssl' now is a set of options, as opposed to a simple boolean switch
      - 'ssl.use' (Boolean) sets if SSL should be used
      - 'ssl.verify' (Boolean) sets if the SSL certificate should be verified
      - 'ssl.ca_path' (String) sets the path to a directory with
        certificates. This has to be set properly for 'ssl.verify' to work.
      - 'ssl.client_cert' (String) allows to set a client certificate,
        which some networks can use for authentication (see
        http://www.oftc.net/oftc/NickServ/CertFP)
  - Instances of Mask can be checked for equality
  - Mask#match has been fixed
  - Timer functionality has been added to plugins
  - A new option 'nicks' has been added which overrules 'nick' and
    allows Cinch to try multiple nicks before appending underscores
  - Proper disconnect and reconnect handling has been added to Cinch
    - Cinch will notice unexpected disconnects
    - New options:
      - timeouts.read    – If no data has been received for X seconds,
        consider the connection dead
      - timeouts.connect – Give up connecting after X seconds
      - ping_interval    – Ping the server every X seconds. This interval
        should be smaller than 'timeouts.read' to prevent Cinch from
        falsely declaring a connection dead
      - reconnect        – If true, try to reconnect after a connection loss
  - pre- and post-execution hooks have been added to the plugin
    architecture
  - A new option 'user_host' has been added, which allows Cinch to
    bind to a specific IP/Host, which is commonly used for using so
    called "vhosts"
  - Added support for RPL_WHOISREGNICK (+r flag on UnrealIRC)
  - Prefixes, suffixes and patterns can now, additionally to strings
    and regexps, also be procs/lambdas, which get executed everytime
    before a message is matched against the pattern. This allows for
    highly dynamic patterns. One possible use case are plugins that
    only respond if the bot was directly addressed.
  - A new encoding called :irc has been added and made the default.
    - If incoming text is valid UTF-8, it will be interpreted as such.
      If it fails validation, a CP1252 -> UTF-8 conversion is
      performed.
    - If your outgoing message contains only characters that fit
      inside the CP1252 code page, the entire message will be sent
      that way. If the text doesn't fit inside the CP1252 code page,
      it will be sent using its original encoding, which should be UTF-8.
    - This hybrid encoding allows Cinch to transparently handle nearly
      all configurations in western countries, even if users in a
      single channel cannot decide on one encoding. The :irc encoding
      exploits the fact that most people either use UTF-8 or CP1252
      (which is nearly identical to ISO-8859-1) and that text encoded
      in CP1252 is not valid in UTF-8.
  - Invalid bytes in incoming messages (e.g. if a wrong encoding has
    been used) will be replaced with question marks (or U+FFFD if
    using UTF-8)

* Cinch 1.0.2, 01 September 2010
  - Left-over debug output has been removed
  - Patterns won't be wrongly modified during registration anymore
  - Using the same internal and external encoding doesn't break Cinch anymore
  - Messages coming from SSL will be properly encoded

* Cinch 1.0.1, 19 August 2010
  - fix several bugs regarding user syncing and unsyncing which cause
    exceptions in the core of Cinch and which don't unsync users who
    quit.

  - first stable release of Cinch
